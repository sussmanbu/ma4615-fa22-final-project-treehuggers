<h2>Data Analysis Motivation</h2>
<p>The variables that we are interested in looking at are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Total of Hospitalizations per county</li>
<li>Total open park area per county</li>
<li>Total area per county</li>
<li>Total number of parks per county</li>
<li>Total hospitalizations per county for race/ethincity</li>
</ul>
<p>Relationships between the variables that we are interested in looking at:</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Some questions that we are interested in answering based on the variables are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does access to green space indicate the likelihood of (childhood?) asthma hospitalization? (Is there a correlation between the amount of green spaces and asthma hospitalizations? Is there a correlation between the number of parks and asthma hospitalizations?)</li>
<li>Does the proportion of county area which is preserved in parks have a different relationship to asthma hospitalizations than the count of parks per county? Is one or the other a better indicator?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rubric: On this page</h2>
<p>you will</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduce what motivates your Data Analysis (DA)
<ul>
<li>Which variables and relationships are you most interested in?</li>
<li>What questions are you interested in answering?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Breadth of the DA
<ul>
<li>Make sure that you ask enough initial questions to explore the different variables in your data.</li>
<li>i.e. Do you explore more than just one or two variables? Do you explore a few different relationships or many?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Depth of the DA
<ul>
<li>When you answer one question, usually more questions arise as well.</li>
<li>The depth of the DA is about coming up with and exploring the answers to these questions, often iterating the process a few times.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Modeling and Inference
<ul>
<li>You should also include some kind of formal statistical model and/or inference. This could be a linear regression, logistic regression, hypothesis testing etc.</li>
<li>Explain the techniques you used for validating your results.</li>
<li>Describe the results of your modelling and make sure to give a sense of the uncertainty in your estimates and conclusions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Explain the flaws and limitations of your analysis
<ul>
<li>Are there some assumptions that you needed to make that might not hold? Is there other data that would help to answer your questions? …</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Clarity Figures
<ul>
<li>Are your figures/tables/results easy to read, informative, without problems like overplotting, hard-to-read labels, etc?</li>
<li>Each figure should provide a key insight. Too many figures or other data summaries can detract from this.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Clarity of Explanations
<ul>
<li>Do you introduce why you are doing each analysis?</li>
<li>How well do you explain each figure/result?</li>
<li>Do you provide interpretations that suggest further analysis or explanations for observed phenomenon?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Organization and cleanliness.
<ul>
<li>Make sure to remove excessive warnings, use clean easy-to-read code, organize with sections or multiple pages, use bullets, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Your Data Analysis can be broken up into multiple pages if that helps with your organization.</p>
