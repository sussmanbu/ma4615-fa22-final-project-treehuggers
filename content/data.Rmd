## Datasets

  Our first dataset, the NaNDA Parks data “Parks by Census Tract, United States, 2018,” came from the following source: https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/117921/version/V1/view. 
  In order to open the dataset, you must create a free account. After this, both the dataset and an accompanying dictionary describing the variables (NaNDA_Parks_by_Census_Tract_2018_v1-1.pdf) can be downloaded. 
  
  This data was collected by Phillippa Clarke, Robert Melendez, and Megan Chenoweth from the University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research. The research was funded by the US department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Aging; and the Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Community Living, National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research. 
  
  This dataset was created by the Trust for Public Land to aid researchers in learning about how access to public parks may contribute to physical and mental health. Since access to parks and greenspace has been shown to positively impact physical activity levels, health while aging, and people’s sense of well-being, this data provides researchers with concrete information about park access within each US census tract so they can further examine the impact of greenspace on health.
  
  In this dataset, park area includes areas with a wide variety of settings including grassy, forested, or paved, among others. Land is designated as a park by governmental authorities and if it is open to the public. This dataset has 11 columns and about 73,000 rows, which represent the census tracts in the US, excluding island territories but including Alaska and Hawai’i. The data is from 2018, but was collated in 2020. It describes the number and area of parks for each census tract. Our variables of interest are described in the table below.
  
  
``` {r echo = FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(suppressWarnings(library(knitr)))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(suppressWarnings(library(tidyverse)))

parks_vars <- tibble(
  "Variable Name" = c("count_open_parks", "tract_area_sqmiles", "tot_park_area_sqmiles", "prop_park_area_tract", "tract_fips10"), 
  "Description" = c("total number of open parks in census tract", "total square mileage of census tract", "total square mileage of park land in census tract","proportion of census land used for parks", "code for the census tract, used for data cleaning to organize data by county")
)

kable(parks_vars)
```
  
  
  
  Other variables in the dataset included count_open_parks_tc10, count_open_parks_tc5, count_open_parks_tc3, and any_open_parks. These were used by the researchers to control for a few census tracts that contained very high numbers of parks, and therefore were top-coded at 10, 5, 3, and 1 (ie, any value greater than n was replaced by the phrase “n or more” in the dataset). Although we explored these variables, they did not end up being extremely relevant to our final analyses. The dataset also included “tract_area” and “tot_park_area”, which described the areas of the census tracts and park lands in square meters, rather than square miles.
  

  Our second dataset, Asthma Hospitalization Rates by County (for California), can be found at the following link: https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/asthma-hospitalization-rates-by-county. This data is publicly accessible and can be freely downloaded, along with the data dictionary. 
  
  This data was collected and published by the California Department of Public Health, along with California Breathing, Environmental Health Investigations Branch. This dataset covers the period from 2015 to 2019 and contains various statistics and demographics related to hospitalizations for asthma. 
  
  Publicly funded hospitals publish annual surveys of some important demographic and health information on a generalized level. This information is collected by the state and distributed to the public; however, in accordance with proper deidentification practices, some of this data has been suppressed if the number of hospitalizations in a certain county is so low that someone could identify the individual person based on the dataset information. 
  
  The variables we focused on within this dataset are described in the table below. 
  

``` {r echo = FALSE}

asthma_vars <- tibble(
  "Variable Name" = c("county", "year", "Age group", "number of hospitalizations", "age-adjusted hospitalization visit rate", "comment", "strata", "strata name"), 
  "Description" = c("county where data was collected", "year when data was collected", "ages of individuals hospitalized, divided into brackets (all ages, 0-4, 0-17, 5-17, 18-64, 18+, 65+)", "number of asthma hospitalizations per county, per year (one person can be hospitalized multiple times)", "numeric that roughly describes the proportion of hospitalizations for a county and age group’s population", "states whether data has been suppressed for this row and why", "general demographic levels like age group or race/ethnicity", "specific categories within strata, like White, Black, etc for race")
)

kable(asthma_vars)
```


  In order to convert the census tracts in the NaNDA Parks dataset to California counties that matched the asthma hospitalizations dataset, we used the FFIEC Online Census Data System. The data used can be found at:  https://www2.census.gov/geo/maps/DC2020/PL20/st06_ca/censustract_maps/. This data is publicly accessible and was create to provide transparency to how the US Census calculates various metrics. We used this dataset primarily for the identification codes that contained the state code, county code and tract number, in order to isolate the California census tracts and separate the tracts out by CA county. 


## Data Cleaning

  During data cleaning, we decided that since we would ultimately be combining the two datasets, we would focus on data from California and 2018 from both of the datasets in order to have a single set of data with the same parameters. 
  
  Therefore, we started by filtering the Parks datasets for only California-based census tracts. To do this, we filtered by the census tract codes that started with “06” - California’s number. We then created a small data dictionary that connected each California county with its census tract numbers and then added “county name” as an additional variable in the dataset. We also did some cleanup of variable names to make them more standardized and clearer for our own use. 
  
  Our code is shown below, along with descriptions of what each segment does:


California Tract Dictionary Setup - isolating the identification codes:

``` {r eval = FALSE}
path <- ("C:/Users/User/Documents/Boston University/2022/Fall/Data Sci in R/ma4615-fa22-final-project-treehuggers/dataset")
#setwd(path)

CAcountytract <- read_csv("CA_countytract.csv", show_col_types=FALSE) %>% 
  
  rename("remaining" = "TYPE; FULLCODE; STATE; COUNTY; TRACT; SHEETS") %>% 
  #creating easier to use name for variable 
  #remains (with or without a number following it) will always have the remainder of the string to be processed 
  #the original variable name gives the order of the values in the string
  
  separate(col="remaining", into = c("TYPE", "remains1"), (5)) %>% 
  #creating TYPE column to distinguish if piece of land is tract, block, state, etc 
  
  separate(col="remains1", into = c("semi1", "remains11"), sep=(1)) %>% 
  #separating leading semicolon into a separate column to delete later
  
  separate(col="remains11", into = c("FULLCODE", "remains2"), sep = (11)) %>% 
  #creating FULLCODE column 
  #need this to fully and uniquely identify a tract
  
  separate(col="remains2", into = c("semi2", "remains22"), sep=(1)) %>% 
  #separating semicolon to delete later
  
  separate(col="remains22", into = c("STATE", "remains3"), sep = (2)) %>% 
  #creating STATE column 
  #gives two number code which indicates what state the piece of land is in
  #should all be the same at 06 because these data are only for within California

  
  separate(col="remains3", into = c("semi3", "remains33"), sep=(1)) %>% 
  #separating semicolon to delete later
  
  separate(col="remains33", into = c("COUNTY", "remains4"), sep = (3)) %>% 
  #creating COUNTY column #gives a three number code which indicates which state the piece of land is in 
  #two counties in different states can have the same county code 
  #each county is only in one state
  #each county contains at least one census tract (some contain many while others have only 1)
  #county names in all capitals
  
  separate(col="remains4", into = c("semi4", "remains44"), sep=(1)) %>% 
  #separating semicolon to delete later
  
  separate(col="remains44", into = c("TRACT", "SHEETS"), sep = ";") %>% 
  #creating TRACT and SHEETS columns 
  #tract column contains a tract number of varying length that identifies a census tract within a state and county 
  #tract location can be found by using state and county 
  #can be places with same tract number in state if they are in different counties 
  #sheets column identifies where maps of the tract can be found
  
  unite(col = "COUNTY_CODE", c("STATE", "COUNTY"), sep="") %>% 
  #uniting columns to make COUNTY_CODE
  #one of our datasets identifies which county something occurs in using this format
  #leaves original columns in dataset because remove=FALSE
  #county code is unique to each county in California
  
  select(-semi1, -semi2, -semi3, -semi4, -"...3", -"...4", -"...5", -"...6") 
  #removing the temporary columns used to move the semi colons
  #remove excess columns accidentally created
  #could reorder columns here if that would be helpful

saveRDS(CAcountytract, "CAcountytract_clean.RData")
#head(CAcountytract)
#if want to test/check the outcome
```



Park Data Cleaning - filtering out extraneous data and selecting column variables of interest:

``` {r eval = FALSE}
tract_ca <- nanda_parks_tract_2018_01P %>% filter(grepl('^06', tract_fips10), any_open_park == 1) 
# filters data so that it’s only the CA counties and also only included counties that had at least 1 open park

clean1_tract <- tract_ca %>% select(tract_fips10, count_open_parks, tract_area_sqmiles, tot_park_area_sqmiles, prop_park_area_tract) 
# selects relevant columns (tracts, open parks per tract, sq miles of tract, total sq miles of parks in tract, proportion of park to tract area)

colnames(clean1_tract) <- c("tractcode", "open_parks_tract", "tract_area_sqmiles", "total_open_park_area_sqmiles", "prop_open_park_land_within_tract") 
# renames columns so it’s more clear what they are

CA_countytract2 <- CA_countytract %>% mutate(tractcode = str_sub(`TYPE; FULLCODE; STATE; COUNTY; TRACT; SHEETS`, 7, 17)) 
# selects for just column with codes and then creates new column that isolates the full code

joined_CA_countytract <- clean1_tract %>% inner_join(CA_countytract2, by = "tractcode") 
# joins the CA_countytract2 table with the clean1_tract table by tractcode, keeping all of the rows where the tractcode from clean1_tract is a match for tractcode in CA_countytract2 

clean2_tract <- joined_CA_countytract %>% select(-`TYPE; FULLCODE; STATE; COUNTY; TRACT; SHEETS`, -...3, -...4, -...5, -...6) 
# gets rid of extraneous columns; only leaves county names

clean2_tract <- clean2_tract[, c(1, 6, 2, 3, 4, 5)] 
# reorders columns to put county name next to code

colnames(clean2_tract) <- c("tractcode", "county_name", "open_parks_tract", "tract_area_sqmiles", "total_open_park_area_sqmiles", "prop_open_park_land_within_tract") 
# quick rename of county name column to be less aggressively uppercase

source(
  here::here("static", "load_and_clean_data.R"),
  echo = FALSE # Use echo=FALSE or omit it to avoid code output  
)

```

  For the asthma hospitalizations dataset, we primarily worked with the "strata" and "strata_names" columns. Since the strata covered both different ranges of ages and race/ethnicity, the existing dataset was not clean enough for analysis. We created new subsets for age groups and race in order to analyze these hospitalization rates separately. After this, we further cleaned the dataset that focused on race in order to create different column variables for the total hospitalizations of each racial group. Our code and explanations for each section of code are shown below.
