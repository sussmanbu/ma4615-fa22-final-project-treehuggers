<h2>Datasets</h2>
<p>Our first dataset, the NaNDA Parks data “Parks by Census Tract, United States, 2018,” came from the following source: <a href="https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/117921/version/V1/view" class="uri">https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/117921/version/V1/view</a>.
In order to open the dataset, you must create a free account. After this, both the dataset and an accompanying dictionary describing the variables (NaNDA_Parks_by_Census_Tract_2018_v1-1.pdf) can be downloaded.</p>
<p>This data was collected by Phillippa Clarke, Robert Melendez, and Megan Chenoweth from the University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research. The research was funded by the US department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Aging; and the Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Community Living, National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research.</p>
<p>This dataset was created by the Trust for Public Land to aid researchers in learning about how access to public parks may contribute to physical and mental health. Since access to parks and greenspace has been shown to positively impact physical activity levels, health while aging, and people’s sense of well-being, this data provides researchers with concrete information about park access within each US census tract so they can further examine the impact of greenspace on health.</p>
<p>In this dataset, park area includes areas with a wide variety of settings including grassy, forested, or paved, among others. Land is designated as a park by governmental authorities and if it is open to the public. This dataset has 11 columns and about 73,000 rows, which represent the census tracts in the US, excluding island territories but including Alaska and Hawai’i. The data is from 2018, but was collated in 2020. It describes the number and area of parks for each census tract. Our variables of interest are described in the table below.</p>

<p>Other variables in the dataset included count_open_parks_tc10, count_open_parks_tc5, count_open_parks_tc3, and any_open_parks. These were used by the researchers to control for a few census tracts that contained very high numbers of parks, and therefore were top-coded at 10, 5, 3, and 1 (ie, any value greater than n was replaced by the phrase “n or more” in the dataset). Although we explored these variables, they did not end up being extremely relevant to our final analyses. The dataset also included “tract_area” and “tot_park_area”, which described the areas of the census tracts and park lands in square meters, rather than square miles.</p>
<p>Our second dataset, Asthma Hospitalization Rates by County (for California), can be found at the following link: <a href="https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/asthma-hospitalization-rates-by-county" class="uri">https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/asthma-hospitalization-rates-by-county</a>. This data is publicly accessible and can be freely downloaded, along with the data dictionary.</p>
<p>This data was collected and published by the California Department of Public Health, along with California Breathing, Environmental Health Investigations Branch. This dataset covers the period from 2015 to 2019 and contains various statistics and demographics related to hospitalizations for asthma.</p>
<p>Publicly funded hospitals publish annual surveys of some important demographic and health information on a generalized level. This information is collected by the state and distributed to the public; however, in accordance with proper deidentification practices, some of this data has been suppressed if the number of hospitalizations in a certain county is so low that someone could identify the individual person based on the dataset information.</p>
<p>The variables we focused on within this dataset are described in the table below.</p>

<p>In order to convert the census tracts in the NaNDA Parks dataset to California counties that matched the asthma hospitalizations dataset, we used the FFIEC Online Census Data System. The data used can be found at: <a href="https://www2.census.gov/geo/maps/DC2020/PL20/st06_ca/censustract_maps/" class="uri">https://www2.census.gov/geo/maps/DC2020/PL20/st06_ca/censustract_maps/</a>. This data is publicly accessible and was create to provide transparency to how the US Census calculates various metrics. We used this dataset primarily for the identification codes that contained the state code, county code and tract number, in order to isolate the California census tracts and separate the tracts out by CA county.</p>

<div id="data-cleaning" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
<p>During data cleaning, we decided that since we would ultimately be combining the two datasets, we would focus on data from California and 2018 from both of the datasets in order to have a single set of data with the same parameters.</p>
<p>Therefore, we started by filtering the Parks datasets for only California-based census tracts. To do this, we filtered by the census tract codes that started with “06” - California’s number. We then created a small data dictionary that connected each California county with its census tract numbers and then added “county name” as an additional variable in the dataset. We also did some cleanup of variable names to make them more standardized and clearer for our own use.</p>
<p>Our code is shown below, along with descriptions of what each segment does:</p>
