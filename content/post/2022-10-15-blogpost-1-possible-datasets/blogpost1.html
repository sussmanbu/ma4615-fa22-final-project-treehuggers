<p>Our group is interested in general themes of green spaces and how that related to the mental or physical health of the population. Within these themes, we have found the following three datasets.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Parks by Census Tract (US, 2018)
Link: <a href="https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/117921/version/V1/view" class="uri">https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/117921/version/V1/view</a>
In order to open the dataset, you must create a free account. We have done this and downloaded the dataset. This dataset has 11 columns and about 73,000 rows, which represent the census tracts in the US, excluding island territories. The data describes the number and area of parks for each census tract. It was created by the Trust for Public Land to aid researchers in learning about how access to public parks may contribute to physical and mental health.
This data is stored in an Excel file, which is easy to load. The data also comes with a data dictionary that describes each variable name and type. Using this data, we hope to learn about patterns in publicly available green spaces across different areas (we would likely try to summarize by county). Within this dataset alone, it would be interesting to explore how the ratio of public land within parks to total area of parks changes across counties. We would also want to cross-reference this dataset with other census data, such as economic levels, racial makeup, or mental health data. The major challenge would likely be summarizing the data from census tract into county and figuring out how the census tract labels translate to specific geographic areas.</p></li>
<li><p>California 2017 Mental Health National Outcome Measures:

</ol>
<p>This dataset contains a large amount of information on mental health services and population mental health patterns within California, as compared to rates in the Western US and US as a whole. This data is collected and reported annually by SAMHSA (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration). Since it’s partially based on grant funding, this information likely influences how funding is directed throughout California’s mental health services in the following year.
This data currently exists in a PDF, but we are able to convert it to an Excel file. Since this data does stratify by race, gender, and age, those would be interesting pathways to explore. We would also be able to compare how California’s mental health services for different populations differ in their use or efficacy from services at a national level. We would want to read through the existing data and choose some specific parts to focus on, as the document has such a large and varied number of smaller datasets that it would be unrealistic to use them all. Also, there is no data dictionary, which means some of the variables are not entirely clear in their meaning.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>State of California: Asthma Hospitalization Rates by County
Link: <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/asthma-hospitalization-rates-by-county-9d17d" class="uri">https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/asthma-hospitalization-rates-by-county-9d17d</a></li>
</ol>
<p>This dataset shows the counts and rates of asthma hospitalizations at county and state levels for California across the years 2015-2019. Data is stratified by age and race/ethnicity. It was collected by the California Department of Public Health. Within this dataset, we can explore the relationships between race or age and asthma hospitalizations. We are using asthma hospitalizations as a public health marker for air pollution. It would be interesting to cross-reference this with the public park data for just California that’s contained within the first dataset, and see how the number of public parks in an area interacts with the number of asthma hospitalizations.
This dataset is in a CVS file that we can load and comes with a data dictionary. One potential issue is that a fair number of datapoints are N.A. as the data has been suppressed, due to state deidentification guidelines. We would want to make sure that some data is available for every county.</p>
