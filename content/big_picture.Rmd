["Did you know trees help prevent asthma and other respiratory diseases? Trees filter particles out of the air we breathe, which decreases our risk of respiratory illnesses, including asthma."](https://forestrynews.blogs.govdelivery.com/2019/05/09/trees-clean-the-air-and-prevent-respiratory-illness/#:~:text=Did%20you%20know%20trees%20help,of%20respiratory%20illnesses%2C%20including%20asthma.) 

The presence of trees and other greenery has long been linked to the idea of clean and clear air. Plants produce the oxygen we breathe, and because of this, a higher number of plants is naturally associated with better air quality. In fact, trees have been shown to help prevent asthma and other respiratory diseases. They filter harmful particles out of the air, which decreases the risk of respiratory illnesses such as asthma.

It is no wonder why many cities have initiatives to plant trees or create more green spaces. The high density of both humans and infrastructure in cities, especially very large ones, coupled with the  low density of trees and other plants, greatly increases the amount of air pollution and the risk of respiratory illness. It is anticipated through scientific studies that a lack of green spaces is correlated to higher rates of asthma. 

We chose to further explore the relationship between the amount of green space in an area and the number of hospitalizations due to asthma to ultimately see the extent to which an increased amount of green spaces improves air quality. We limited our analysis to the counties in California, and in addition to comparing the amount of green space to the asthma hospitalization rate, we explored any potential significant discrepancies between the hospitalizations of different races and age groups to see who, if anyone, is at higher risk of being hospitalized for asthma and what relationship, if any, this has with the amount of green space.


## Looking at Open Park Area and Asthma Hospitalizations 
We began with two sets of data, one containing information about the amount of open green spaces in different California counties and the other documenting the number of hospitalizations due to asthma based on age and race in each county. Firstly, we examined which counties had the most green space and greatest number of hospitalizations. The only county we did not include in these analyses was Los Angeles, because its drastically larger population and size made it an outlier.

This plot looks at the total number and total area (in square miles) of open parks in each California county.

```{r echo=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(suppressWarnings(library(tidyverse)))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(suppressWarnings(library(plotly)))
load(here::here("dataset/asthmaCA_kids.RData"))
load(here::here("dataset/asthmaCA_kids_v_adults.RData"))
load(here::here("dataset/asthmaCA_kids_2.RData"))
load(here::here("dataset/asthmaCA_race_ethnicity.RData"))
load(here::here("dataset/clean_parks_data.RData"))
load(here::here("dataset/parks_asthmaCA_kids.RData"))
load(here::here("dataset/parks_asthmaCA_kids_v_adults.RData"))
load(here::here("dataset/parks_asthmaCA_kids_2.RData"))
load(here::here("dataset/parks_asthmaCA_race_ethnicity.RData"))

sums <- parks_asthmaCA_kids %>% group_by(county_name) %>% mutate(total_tract_area = sum(tract_area_sqmiles), total_open_park_area = sum(total_open_park_area_sqmiles), num_open_parks = sum(open_parks_tract))

avgs <- parks_asthmaCA_kids %>% group_by(county_name) %>% mutate(avg_tract_area = mean(tract_area_sqmiles), avg_open_park_area = mean(total_open_park_area_sqmiles), avg_num_open_parks = mean(open_parks_tract))

suppressWarnings(
  ggplotly(sums %>% ggplot(aes(x = num_open_parks, y = total_open_park_area, col = county_name)) + geom_point() + labs(x = "Number of Open Parks", y = "Area of Open Parks", title = "Open Parks & Area", legend = "County"))
  )

```

As we can see, the county with the most open park spaces is Orange (1170), but the county with the greatest area of open park space is Riverside (1742 sq miles). We can also see that these counties are fairly significant outliers; every county except Orange has under 700 open parks and every county except Riverside has under 900 square miles of open park land. A significant number of counties are clustered at under 10 square miles of open park land. 


In this second plot, we explore the relationship between the amount of open park area and the total hospitalization counts across California districts. 
``` {r echo = FALSE}
load(here::here("dataset/CA_county_asthma_parks.Rdata"))

suppressWarnings(
  ggplotly(CA_county_asthma_parks %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = total_county_park_area_sqm, y = number_hospitalizations_total, col = county_name)) + geom_point() + scale_color_gradient(name = "Total County Area (sqm)") + ylim(0,1500) + labs(title = "Total Open Park Area vs. Number of Asthma Hospitalizations Across California Counties", x = "Open Park Area (sq miles)", y = "Number of Asthma Hospitalizations", subtitle = "Data from 2018, excludes Los Angeles county.") + scale_color_viridis_d())
)
```

We can see that generally, towards the left side of the graph, where the amount of open park area is lower, the hospitalization totals extend to much higher values. Towards the right side of the graph, counties with very high square mileages of open parks generally have very low numbers of hospitalizations. This suggests that counties with higher amounts of open park space might have lower asthma hospitalization numbers, but further exploration is needed, particularly as there are fewer counties with high open park space totals.

Think of this page as your 538/Upshot style article. This means that you should try to tell a story through the data and your analysis. Read articles from those sites and similar sites to get a feeling for what they are like. Importantly, these should be geared towards the general public. You shouldn't assume the reader understands how to interpret a linear regression. Focus on interpretation and visualizations.

## Rubric: On this page

You will



* Title
  * Your big picture page should have a creative/click-baity title/headline that provides a hint about your thesis.
* Clarity of Explanation
  * You should have a clear thesis/goal for this page. What are you trying to show? Make sure that you explain your analysis in detail but don't go into top much mathematics or statistics. The audience for this page is the general public (to the extent possible).
* Quality of Figures
  * Each figure should be very polished and also not too complicated. There should be a clear interpretation of the figure so the figure has a clear purpose. Even something like a histogram can be difficult to interpret for non-experts.
* Creativity
  * Do your best to make things interesting. Think of a story. Think of how each part of your analysis supports the previous part or provides a different perspective.
  
**Note**: This page should have no code visible, i.e. use `echo=FALSE`.

## Rubric: Other components

### Interactive

You will also be required to make an interactive dashboard like [this one](/flex/flex.html).

Your Big Data page should include a link to an interactive dashboard. The dashboard should be created either using Shiny or FlexDashboard (or another tool with professor's approval). This interactive component should in some way support your thesis from your big picture page. Good interactives often provide both high-level understanding of the data while allowing a user to investigate specific scenarios, observations, subgroups, etc.

* Quality and ease of use of the interactive components.
Is it clear what can be explored using your interactive components?
Does it enhance and reinforce your conclusions from the Big Picture?
Plotly with default hover text will get no credit. Be creative!


### Video Recording

Make a video recording (probably using Zoom) demonstrating your interactive components.
You should provide a quick explanation of your data and demonstrate some of the conclusions from your EDA.
This video should be no longer than 4 minutes.
Include a link to your video (and password if needed) in your README.md file on your Github repository. You are not required to provide a link on the website.
This can be presented by any subset of the team members.


### Rest of the Site

Finally, here are important things to keep in mind for the rest of the site. 

The main title of your page is informative.
Each post has an author/description/informative title.
All lab required posts are present.
Each page (including the home page) has a nice featured image associated with it.
Your about page is up to date and clean.
You have removed the generic posts from the initial site template.
