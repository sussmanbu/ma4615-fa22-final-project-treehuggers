["Did you know trees help prevent asthma and other respiratory diseases? Trees filter particles out of the air we breathe, which decreases our risk of respiratory illnesses, including asthma."](https://forestrynews.blogs.govdelivery.com/2019/05/09/trees-clean-the-air-and-prevent-respiratory-illness/#:~:text=Did%20you%20know%20trees%20help,of%20respiratory%20illnesses%2C%20including%20asthma.) 

The presence of trees and other greenery has long been linked to the idea of clean and clear air. Plants produce the oxygen we breathe, and because of this, a higher number of plants is naturally associated with better air quality. In fact, trees have been shown to help prevent asthma and other respiratory diseases. They filter harmful particles out of the air, which decreases the risk of respiratory illnesses such as asthma.

It is no wonder why many cities have initiatives to plant trees or create more green spaces. The high density of both humans and infrastructure in cities, especially very large ones, coupled with the  low density of trees and other plants, greatly increases the amount of air pollution and the risk of respiratory illness. It is anticipated through scientific studies that a lack of green spaces is correlated to higher rates of asthma. 

We chose to explore the relationship between the amount of green space and the number of asthma hospitalizations in California to ultimately learn whether increased green space improves air quality and has a positive impact on public health. In addition to comparing the amount of green space to the asthma hospitalization rate, we explored the differences between asthma hospitalization rates of different races and age groups to see who, if anyone, is at higher risk of being hospitalized for asthma and what relationship, if any, this has with the amount of green space.


## Looking at Open Park Area and Asthma Hospitalizations 
We began with two sets of data, one containing information about the amount of open green spaces in different California counties and the other documenting the number of hospitalizations due to asthma based on age and race in each county. Firstly, we examined which counties had the most green space and greatest number of hospitalizations. The only county we did not include in these analyses was Los Angeles, because its drastically larger population and size made it an outlier.

This plot looks at the total number and total area (in square miles) of open parks in each California county.

```{r echo=FALSE}

load(here::here("dataset/asthmaCA_kids.RData"))
load(here::here("dataset/asthmaCA_kids_v_adults.RData"))
load(here::here("dataset/asthmaCA_kids_2.RData"))
load(here::here("dataset/asthmaCA_race_ethnicity.RData"))

load(here::here("dataset/parks_asthmaCA_kids_2.RData"))
load(here::here("dataset/parks_asthmaCA_race_ethnicity.RData"))

sums <- parks_asthmaCA_kids %>% group_by(county_name) %>% mutate(total_tract_area = sum(tract_area_sqmiles), total_open_park_area = sum(total_open_park_area_sqmiles), num_open_parks = sum(open_parks_tract))

avgs <- parks_asthmaCA_kids %>% group_by(county_name) %>% mutate(avg_tract_area = mean(tract_area_sqmiles), avg_open_park_area = mean(total_open_park_area_sqmiles), avg_num_open_parks = mean(open_parks_tract))

suppressWarnings(
  ggplotly(sums %>% ggplot(aes(x = num_open_parks, y = total_open_park_area, col = county_name)) + geom_point() + labs(x = "Number of Open Parks", y = "Area of Open Parks", title = "Open Parks & Area", legend = "County"))
  )

```

As we can see, the county with the most open park spaces is Orange (1170), but the county with the greatest area of open park space is Riverside (1742 sq miles). We can also see that these counties are fairly significant outliers; every county except Orange has under 700 open parks and every county except Riverside has under 900 square miles of open park land. A significant number of counties are clustered at under 10 square miles of open park land. 


In this second plot, we explore the relationship between the amount of open park area and the total hospitalization counts across California districts. 
``` {r echo = FALSE}
load(here::here("dataset/CA_county_asthma_parks.Rdata"))

suppressWarnings(
  ggplotly(CA_county_asthma_parks %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = total_county_park_area_sqm, y = number_hospitalizations_total, col = county_name)) + geom_point() + scale_color_gradient(name = "Total County Area (sqm)") + ylim(0,1500) + labs(title = "Total Open Park Area vs. Number of Asthma Hospitalizations Across California Counties", x = "Open Park Area (sq miles)", y = "Number of Asthma Hospitalizations", subtitle = "Data from 2018, excludes Los Angeles county.") + scale_color_viridis_d())
)
```

We can see that generally, towards the left side of the graph, where the amount of open park area is lower, the hospitalization totals extend to much higher values. Towards the right side of the graph, counties with very high square mileages of open parks generally have very low numbers of hospitalizations. This suggests that counties with higher amounts of open park space might have lower asthma hospitalization numbers, but further exploration is needed, particularly as there are fewer counties with high open park space totals.
