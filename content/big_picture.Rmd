["Did you know trees help prevent asthma and other respiratory diseases? Trees filter particles out of the air we breathe, which decreases our risk of respiratory illnesses, including asthma."](https://forestrynews.blogs.govdelivery.com/2019/05/09/trees-clean-the-air-and-prevent-respiratory-illness/#:~:text=Did%20you%20know%20trees%20help,of%20respiratory%20illnesses%2C%20including%20asthma.) 

Air pollution and asthma are closely linked to each other. And what takes part of this air pollution? Deforestation and Infrastructure. Based on scientific studies of trees, air pollution, and asthma, it is anticipated that locations with less green spaces will have higher rates of asthma. Let's take a closer look at this idea in the state of California in 2018. 

In this project, we will be looking at Parks data, which includes the number and area of parks in each county of CA, and Asthma data, which includes the number and rate of hospitalization in each county by age and race/ethnicity.  

Let's take a look at each dataset separately:
First, we have the total number and area (square miles) of open parks in each county. Some counties may have more open parks, but the parks have a smaller area compared to other counties that may have less open parks, but the area of the parks there are much bigger.
```{r echo=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plotly))
load(here::here("dataset/asthmaCA_kids.RData"))
load(here::here("dataset/asthmaCA_kids_v_adults.RData"))
load(here::here("dataset/asthmaCA_kids_2.RData"))
load(here::here("dataset/asthmaCA_race_ethnicity.RData"))
load(here::here("dataset/clean_parks_data.RData"))
load(here::here("dataset/parks_asthmaCA_kids.RData"))
load(here::here("dataset/parks_asthmaCA_kids_v_adults.RData"))
load(here::here("dataset/parks_asthmaCA_kids_2.RData"))
load(here::here("dataset/parks_asthmaCA_race_ethnicity.RData"))

sums <- parks_asthmaCA_kids %>% group_by(county_name) %>% mutate(total_tract_area = sum(tract_area_sqmiles), total_open_park_area = sum(total_open_park_area_sqmiles), num_open_parks = sum(open_parks_tract))

avgs <- parks_asthmaCA_kids %>% group_by(county_name) %>% mutate(avg_tract_area = mean(tract_area_sqmiles), avg_open_park_area = mean(total_open_park_area_sqmiles), avg_num_open_parks = mean(open_parks_tract))

ggplotly(sums %>% ggplot(aes(x = num_open_parks, y = total_open_park_area, col = county_name)) + geom_point() + labs(x = "Number of Open Parks", y = "Area of Open Parks", title = "Open Parks & Area", legend = "County"))

```
In this plot, we are able to see clearly which county has the most number of open parks (ORANGE) and which county has the largest area of open parks (RIVERSIDE). 

Now, here is a look at the total number and rate of asthma hospitalizations in each county of California:
```{r echo=FALSE}
asthma <- read.csv(here::here("dataset", "asthma.csv")) 
asthma$NUMBER_OF_HOSPITALIZATIONS <- as.numeric(asthma$NUMBER_OF_HOSPITALIZATIONS)

asthma_2018 <- asthma %>% 
  filter(YEAR == "2018", 
         COUNTY != "California", 
         STRATA_NAME == "All ages", 
         !is.na(NUMBER_OF_HOSPITALIZATIONS),
         !is.na(AGE_ADJUSTED_HOSPITALIZATION_RATE))
  
ggplotly(asthma_2018 %>% ggplot(aes(y = NUMBER_OF_HOSPITALIZATIONS, x = AGE_ADJUSTED_HOSPITALIZATION_RATE, col = COUNTY)) + geom_point() + labs(y = "Hospitalization Count", x = "Hospitalization Rate", title = "Total Rate and # of Hospitalizations") + scale_color_viridis_d())
```

___
Think of this page as your 538/Upshot style article. This means that you should try to tell a story through the data and your analysis. Read articles from those sites and similar sites to get a feeling for what they are like. Importantly, these should be geared towards the general public. You shouldn't assume the reader understands how to interpret a linear regression. Focus on interpretation and visualizations.

## Rubric: On this page

You will



* Title
  * Your big picture page should have a creative/click-baity title/headline that provides a hint about your thesis.
* Clarity of Explanation
  * You should have a clear thesis/goal for this page. What are you trying to show? Make sure that you explain your analysis in detail but don't go into top much mathematics or statistics. The audience for this page is the general public (to the extent possible).
* Quality of Figures
  * Each figure should be very polished and also not too complicated. There should be a clear interpretation of the figure so the figure has a clear purpose. Even something like a histogram can be difficult to interpret for non-experts.
* Creativity
  * Do your best to make things interesting. Think of a story. Think of how each part of your analysis supports the previous part or provides a different perspective.
  
**Note**: This page should have no code visible, i.e. use `echo=FALSE`.

## Rubric: Other components

### Interactive

You will also be required to make an interactive dashboard like [this one](/flex/flex.html).

Your Big Data page should include a link to an interactive dashboard. The dashboard should be created either using Shiny or FlexDashboard (or another tool with professor's approval). This interactive component should in some way support your thesis from your big picture page. Good interactives often provide both high-level understanding of the data while allowing a user to investigate specific scenarios, observations, subgroups, etc.

* Quality and ease of use of the interactive components.
Is it clear what can be explored using your interactive components?
Does it enhance and reinforce your conclusions from the Big Picture?
Plotly with default hover text will get no credit. Be creative!


### Video Recording

Make a video recording (probably using Zoom) demonstrating your interactive components.
You should provide a quick explanation of your data and demonstrate some of the conclusions from your EDA.
This video should be no longer than 4 minutes.
Include a link to your video (and password if needed) in your README.md file on your Github repository. You are not required to provide a link on the website.
This can be presented by any subset of the team members.


### Rest of the Site

Finally, here are important things to keep in mind for the rest of the site. 

The main title of your page is informative.
Each post has an author/description/informative title.
All lab required posts are present.
Each page (including the home page) has a nice featured image associated with it.
Your about page is up to date and clean.
You have removed the generic posts from the initial site template.
